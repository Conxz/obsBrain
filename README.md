# obsBrain
Observatory of Brain

- With this application, researchers could easily research and explore **regional gene expression in the human brain**. 
- Links: Scripts on Github [obsBrain](https://github.com/Conxz/obsBrain) and application online [obsBrain](https://conxz.shinyapps.io/obsbrain/). 

- Data display is based on the Desikanâ€“Killiany atlas (with 34 parcels in each hemisphere) from [FreeSurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). 
- In the current version, two data sources of gene expression are included ([French et al., 2015](https://dx.doi.org/10.3389%2Ffnins.2015.00323); [Arnatkeviciute et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1101/380089)), both of which are derived from the [Allen Human Brain Atlas](http://human.brain-map.org/).
