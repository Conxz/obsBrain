# obsBrain
Observatory of Brain

- With this application, researchers could easily search and visualise regional effects in the human brain. 
- Data display is based on the Desikan–Killiany atlas (with 34 parcels in each hemisphere) from [FreeSurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/), which has been widely used in multi-site collaborative project, e.g., ENIGMA. 
- Links: Scripts on Github [obsBrain](https://github.com/Conxz/obsBrain) and application online [obsBrain](https://conxz.shinyapps.io/obsbrain/). 
- We would like to acknowledge to [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), [ggseg](https://github.com/LCBC-UiO/ggseg), and [feather](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/feather/index.html) R packages.


**Gene in Brain**
- With this application, researchers could easily research and explore regional gene expression in the human brain. 
- In the current version, two data sources of gene expression are included ([French et al., 2015](https://dx.doi.org/10.3389%2Ffnins.2015.00323); [Arnatkeviciute et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1101/380089)), both of which are derived from the [Allen Human Brain Atlas](http://human.brain-map.org/). 

**obsBrain Viewer**
- With this tab, researchers could easily visualise regional effects based on the Desikan–Killiany atlas. 
- Prepare file based on this [input file template](https://github.com/Conxz/obsBrain/blob/master/info/obsDat.csv). Note that do NOT change the first two columns (i.e., 'area' and 'hemi'). Other useful files are provided [Here](https://github.com/Conxz/obsBrain/tree/master/info/).
